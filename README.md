The study question of this project is to identify the trends of suicide rates over years for 3 high-rate countries (Lithuania, Sri Lanka, Russian Federation), and compare the trends to that of the US.
This project serves as a final project of the Spring 2019 FAES BIOF309 class.

Using techniques and resources learned in class over the semester, I:
1. Identified a dataset (from Kaggle)
2. Download dataset with Kaggle API
3. Imported and cleaned data with Python (Pandas)
4. Graph results using Seaborn package
5. Made a. markdown document, b. Python Notebook, c. HTML Slides, d. Binder documentations of results
6. Upload all documentations to GitHub repository using PyCharm with version control features
